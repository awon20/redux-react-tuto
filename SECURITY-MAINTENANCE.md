# Security maintenance — 2026-10-15

Removed unused Babel 6 and node-sass packages. Updated the development server and middleware; corrected webpack configuration and action-creator imports. Development servers listen on localhost. Generated bundles are no longer committed.

Compatible dependency updates and a weekly Dependabot configuration are included. CRA 3/4 projects move to react-scripts 5.0.1 to build with current Node versions; React itself retains its existing major version. Legacy peer declarations are retained through the documented npm legacy-peer-deps setting.

## Validation

Installation: passed. Build: passed.

npm audit reports 0 affected packages: 0 critical, 0 high, 0 moderate, 0 low. Baseline total: 66.

Nested webpack-demo audit: 7 affected packages. Build covers this nested application.

## Limits and deployment

This is a source/dependency maintenance review, not a security certification or a penetration test. npm audit counts vulnerable packages, not distinct exploitable defects. Legacy build tooling still has known advisories and requires a future migration; a successful build does not resolve those advisories. Audit suggestions to replace react-scripts with a nonfunctional package must not be applied automatically.

Local builds used Node 24.19.0 and npm 11.21.0 with installation lifecycle scripts disabled. Existing lint warnings are not treated as a successful lint audit. Browser permissions, live hosting configuration, account MFA, branch protections, cloud IAM, and full Git history were not comprehensively verified.

Reproduce with `npm ci --ignore-scripts`, `npm audit`, and `npm run build`. For redux-react-tuto, install at the root and in webpack-demo, then build in webpack-demo.
